		<p><b>Delta Vega:</b></p>
		A concept creature I conceived that lives on Star Trek's Delta Vega. A gentle humanoid species that relies on roots under the ice, the creature is large and bulky relying on its strength to find food and escape from predators. It has a strong sense of smell and extraordinary sight which helps it survive and find its main food source on the dark icy planet. It has rows of small grinding teeth similar to that of a cow. Itâ€™s skin is similar to that of a shark allowing for the tempered weather to have minimal effect, and the coarseness of the skin keeps any ice from collecting as it would on fur.

		I painted him using reference from a great white shark, the dark grey and how it transitions to a piercing white underneath. Using his dark skin to absorb as much heat possible, while the white under his face and chest limits the amount of reflection off the snow to affect his sight.

		<p><b>S.M.P. aka Slow Moving Predator</b></p>
		Originally my wife had a nightmare that she was trying to find her way out of an abandoned apartment complex and was 'being chased by these menacing slugs'. Everything they slid over dissolved away from the acid in their slime, as long as a football with eyes on top of the body, a mouth in the front middle section, and hundreds of feelers on both sides.

		When creating the slug I immediately thought of where it would have come from, a lush wooded forest that has plenty of rain. I wanted to capture an image of the slug as if discovering it for the first time, before it was harnessed as a weapon to hunt people down...haha.

		An alien species developed from references of the sea turtle, amphibians and an octopus. It lives on an earth like planet where life has evolved to a hexapedal genome base. A large ocean based creature that can lay its eggs both on land and in the water. The planet it lives on is much larger than Earth with longer seasons. So, migration demands multiple times of laying eggs either on sandy beaches or in shallow kelp fields.

		Six extremities have become critical to its survival helping the creature glide through the water and move seamlessly on land. The creature can breathe air or water and is a herbivore. They are very social creatures, living in large family groups. Another reason that migration is so important, they eat up food sources quickly having to move on in search of their next meal.

		This is the start of a series of portraits with radical teeth. The plan is to show the character in different clothing stereotypes to define his character such as a hoodie, a suit, and crown with royal coronation garments. I decided to start it off with no clothing to demonstrate his menacing nature. Showing him for what he really is, a monster. Additional portraits coming soon...
